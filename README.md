# beginner_pyhon_excersises

Welcome to the beginner_python_excersises!

I was starting to learn programming five times. First time it was in January 2018, I tried to learn C++. And I gave up. 
Next time I want to learn Javascript and frontend development in January 2019. Third time, I tried to learn Python in September 2019. 
I've got saved few lessons from that time And I gave up. 
Than I look for some mobile development and others technolgies, but I can't find anything for me. 
I was jumping between frontend and python but I didn't know what I want. I didn't have any goal. 
Next in June 2020 I thought that I could be a game developer or maybe mobile game dev and I tried to learn C# and godot. 
And of course I wanted to create my own game, games and to do business.

From almost three and a half year I've got a dream. I wanna be a developer. But I don't know how to learn, how to start and what technology tochoose.

So I set up a goal - to be a python developer till January 2024.

It is my fifth attempt - it must succeed.

It will be my Journey, to be a Junior python developer.
